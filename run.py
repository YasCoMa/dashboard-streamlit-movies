            This tool performs a series of exploration analysis in the movies dataset: 
            - General analysis using a world map, votes distribution and missing columns (data quality)
            - Insights inferred from data analysis about the gross, budget and overall score.  
            - Actors and movie network analysis showing the hubs (movie stars) according to the movies in a score range
            - Analysis of most successful writers and directors
